This mod works by detecting whenever the LevelSequencePlayer starts playing from a frame, 
then intercepting select frames to execute our own code.
LevelSequences in P3R generally pause after each dialogue, and play when advancing dialogue.
We can skip significant frames in the default LevelSequence by jumping to frames after them.
(e.g.: jump to the frame before the next dialogue)

However, implementing any delays (with ExecuteWithDelay()) does not work well with fastforwarding,
and there are often race condition issues when playing animations and setting transforms.
Hopefully in the future we can edit the LevelSequence file directly!

LevelSequences by default run at 30 FPS. Dividing the frame number by 30 will give you the time in seconds.
In the .uasset file for LevelSequences, the frame number is multiplied by 800.


AtlEvtPlayObject
=========
Handles event starting and ending. We use this to detect when the sequence starts playing.


LevelSequencePlayer
=========
Master of the LevelSequence. Handles playing.

Play()
---------
Resumes from current frame.

Pause()
---------
Pauses at the current frame.

JumpToSeconds()
---------
Moves to the given time (in seconds). Does not execute frame events before this time.

PlayToSeconds()
---------
Moves to the given time (in seconds), executing frame events before this time.


AppCharacterComp
=========
This class handles a lot of blueprint stuff used in sequences. Mostly to do with animations.

PlayAnim_DefaultSlot()
---------
Takes an AnimSequence, returns an AnimMontage and then plays it to DefaultSlot.

PlayFaceAnimation()
---------
Plays an expression on the actor's face using the FaceAnimID. You can find these IDs in FModel or by object dumping with UE4SS.

PauseAnim()
---------
Pauses the given AnimMontage.


BPAtlEvtActorComp
=========
Generally event-specific blueprint class for actors.

SpawnHandwritingAttachedDefaultParam()
---------
Spawns handwriting (a comic effect, like exclamation marks) over the actor's head. Uses IDs.


SkeletalMeshComponent
=========
The skeleton of an actor. Use the K2_ functions to move/rotate the actor.


CineCameraComponent
=========
Scene's camera. Use the K2_ functions to move/rotate the camera.
